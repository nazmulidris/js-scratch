          Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply
          calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and
          crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems.
          Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters.
          I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb
          had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations
          in subspace frequencies.

          We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a
          remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of
          the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et
          cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand
          times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal
          energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

          Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7.
          Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters
          off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is
          depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of
          natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers
          experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly
          de-phased by the anyon beam.

          Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the
          photon torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The
          weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as
          tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by
          our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement
          in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All
          transporters off.

          Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous
          system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms
          fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the
          transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a
          K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's
          critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium,
          highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.
